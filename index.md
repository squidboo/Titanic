Though thought of in 1907, the Titanic was not made until the 31st of March, 1909 in Belfast, Ireland. The construction of the Titanic went on for 3 years, ending on the 31st of May, 1911. The Titanic was supposedly indestructible, Setting sail on Wednesday the 10th of April 1912, from Southampton. 

##The Iceberg
 
The iceberg was a [growler](http://www.athropolis.com/arctic-facts/fact-bergy-bits.htm), mostly submerged underwater. It was 50 to 100 feet in height, 200 to 400 feet in length. The iceberg hit the Titanic, in the North Atlantic, on the right hand side near the engine. The Titanic was 450 miles from New York when the iceberg hit her.
